# `tdl` -- A dirt-simple to-do list

`tdl` is meant as a learning project for Node, Angular, and Express.
Maybe it'll grow into something useful.

### Tech

*Express* for a back-end.

*AngularJS* for a front-end.  Maybe Bootstrap for UI stuff later.

*gulp* for build management.

*npm* for package management; no need to get fancy yet.

*karma* and *jasmine* for testing.
