# DevProjects

A collection of software projects ranging from the useful to the
frivolous.

## geom (C++11, scons)

A basic geometry library, so far covering only 2d homogeneous points,
vectors, and matrices.  Largely a (re-)learning project for TDD and
gtest, but probably the most likely project to become truly useful.
