# DevProjects

A collection of software projects ranging from the useful to the
frivolous.

## geom (C++11, scons)

A basic geometry library, so far covering only 2d homogeneous points,
vectors, and matrices.  Largely a (re-)learning project for TDD and
gtest, but probably the most likely project to become truly useful.

## MaddenGraph (C#)
Now lives in [its own repo](https://github.com/MattJOlson/MaddenGraph)
because I got sick of managing feature branches in a single monolithic
repository.

## sandbox

A place for simple(-ish) programming problems, experiments with new
languages, APIs, and techniques, and anything that doesn't fit into an
actual project.

## Utils
Now lives in [its own repo](https://github.com/MattJOlson/MattUtils)
because I prefer having one repo per project.
