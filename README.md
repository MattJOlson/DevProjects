# DevProjects

A collection of software projects ranging from the useful to the
frivolous.

## geom (C++11, scons)

A basic geometry library, so far covering only 2d homogeneous points,
vectors, and matrices.  Largely a (re-)learning project for TDD and
gtest, but probably the most likely project to become truly useful.

## MaddenGraph (C#)

A very incomplete American football offensive playbook editor, intended
primarily for people who take Madden a bit too seriously.  Originally
developed in Mono-Develop until stetic irretrievably corrupted my GUI
spec; now I'm considering rewriting it in inline GTK# like I should have
to begin with.

## sandbox

A place for simple(-ish) programming problems, experiments with new
languages, APIs, and techniques, and anything that doesn't fit into an
actual project.

## Utils

A collection of (mostly pretty simple) utility libraries for C# that
might maybe make it into Nuget some day.
